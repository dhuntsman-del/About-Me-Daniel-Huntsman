                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I am a BYU pre-business student with a 3.93 GPA, supported by multiple academic scholarships. I currently work as a Junior Analyst at EPIC Ventures, where I source early-stage tech investments and assist with due diligence on a $200M+ fund. My experience also includes working with alternative investments at Soltis Wealth Advisors and developing strategic initiatives for the nonprofit My Story Matters. I placed second out of more than 25 teams in BYU’s Commercial Real Estate Case Competition. I’ve demonstrated leadership through humanitarian service in Puerto Rico, two years as a missionary in Tahiti, and as captain of my varsity basketball team. I am fluent in English, French, and Tahitian, and I enjoy high-altitude ice climbing and college athletics.</p>
